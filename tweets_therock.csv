The little Queen's have spoken - we LOVED the LITTLE MERMAID. Huge thank you to the amazing @hallebailey + director Rob Marshall, @disneystudios for being so gracious and kind. The invite, the movie, the toys, the SNACKS. I'm very impressed with Halle's performance on the big screen - what presence and charisma, but perhaps more importantly- I've been super impressed with Halle's grace and mana as she's moved thru this global spotlight with maturity and soul. I didn't realize it, til these little munchkins asked me to google her - but Halle's just a kid herself. Impressive. Halle, keep being the 'hardest worker in the room' and sky's the limit. Look forward to working with you one day. And the coolest part of the day - for me - as a proud girl dad - was watching our little girls of color, watch Halle and all the mermaids on the big screen and these little ones didn't think twice about it because - that's their norm. All shades, all colors. Very cool. Congrats again & mahalo and our families had a great time at the movies!
Dropped these dope new 305's inspired from my football days back when we were ballin' out at THE U. I played with monsters and learned so many life lessons that I carry with me today. Work ethic. Hunger. Nasty. Fun. All it takes is all U've got. #305s #PR5s #94 THANK YOU @ProjectRock Universe for making us THE #1TRAINING SHOE FRANCHISE for all of @underarmour
Grateful for the team we're assembling for MOANA. Very inspired by Tommy Kail's spirit, drive & passion to create something special with MOANA for families around the world. He's won multiple Tony's for directing HAMILTON and IN THE HEIGHTS, so he has that intrinsic reverence for history and culture — music and dance — edge and vibe. Story of MOANA and playing MAUI is deeply personal to me, our culture and ancestors. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity for us and I'm honored to go shoulder to shoulder with our director, Thomas Kail and our entire team.
94 days! Canes countdown!!
The context of our @Teremana growth compared to Casamigos is pretty staggering. Thank you all so much for trusting and enjoying our tequila. We have so much work ahead of us here in the US + internationalization of the brand. No shortcuts. Quality, taste, price.
It's ironic his new comedy movie is called #TheMachine because that's exactly what my buddy @bertkreischer has become as he's working his ass off to promote it - a f*cking MACHINE! Wishing you all the success in the world this weekend at the box office brother!! I'm rooting you on! And let's crush some cheat meals and @Teremana for the WIN!!
Keep working hard my man and making progress. Appreciate you making @ZOAenergy part of your journey.
Ok ok ok! Crazy intel, I've wrestled in every major city (and small towns too) in every state, across our great country - drove every major highway and artery that I could fit my truck on. Earning the name #KwikTripKing. Appreciate the @ZOAenergy partnership!!
You daughter is very talented! Tell her Maui says “thank you, and you’re welcome”
It's on - not now, but RIGHT NOW. @ZOAenergy is @Amazon's DEAL OF THE DAY. Big shout to our Amazon partners, for always aligning with me to deliver quality and take care of the people. For 24 hours, you're gonna save a ton of cash and enjoy the ONLY energy drink that delivers no jitters and no crash. Hit the link to get the goods. Enjoy! ~ dj founder
We come from warriors and fighters. Horns forward spirit. Mana. I think all cultures should be illuminated year around, on any day that ends with Y. Proud of my roots, Black & Samoan. (with my Hebrew thrown in
"You're welcome, but thank YOU for the kind words. That ""run"" you go on when I kick this video off is ridiculous. Your cadence is on fire. Keep doing it strong, brother. Appreciate you!!"
"So cool and grateful to see this - how impactful our @XFL2023 is becoming to growing and expanding the game of football. By the time @NFL camps begin this fall, we'll have 60+ players signed to NFL teams. Creating ""the league of opportunity"" is our goal and we're in this for the long haul. Thank you guys for all your support. Player #54"
"We did it! We launched an entire professional football league and crowned a NEW #XFL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM!! Massive congratulations to our @XFLRenegades and head coach @CoachBobStoops & coaching staff on their first championship season. From the call I received back in 2020 from our visionary XFL Chairwoman @DanyGarciaCo saying ""I want us to buy the XFL"" all the way to this past weekend as we proudly and gratefully presented our XFL Championship trophy. Very surreal. A testament to the relentless hard work we put in to passionately create ""The League of Opportunity."" THANK YOU to our entire @XFL2023 organization and THANK YOU to our hyped and loyal XFL FANS across our country. We are all building this league - TOGETHER."
As always, it's our privilege to honor our military service members. Thank you for your service, and we look forward to seeing you again. And thank you for joining us!
Big things, my guy! Keep doing it strong and congratulations on becoming champions this weekend! Digging 'Sweet Tea'! Cool vibe & catchy.
Happy Mother's Day to all the mamas out there. I always say if we got a good solid mom, then we have a shot at turning out to be a decent human being. I got lucky, my mom's a good one. Y'all enjoy your day getting loved up and illuminated. It all starts with our moms.
"What a game. What a season. What an honor. Thank you to all the fans who made this an electrifying XFL season. @XFLRenegades @XFLDefenders. Together, we are all building the ""League of Opportunity."""
Full circle moment. As owner of @XFL2023, it's truly an honor to create opportunities for our players. New champions crowned. @XFLRenegades. #XFLChampionship. XFL Chairwoman.
Appreciate chopping up depression with my guys on @thepivot. I've worked hard over the years to gain the emotional tools to work thru any mental pain that may come to test me. But years ago I didn't know what mental health struggle was. As men we didn't talk about it. We just kept our head down and worked thru it. Not healthy but it's all we knew. If you're going thru your own version of mental wellness turning into mental hell-ness, the most important thing you can do is talk to somebody. It can't be fixed if you keep that pain inside. Having the courage to talk to someone is your superpower. I lost two friends to suicide. Talk to someone. Despite how you may feel, you're never alone.
"Welcome to the Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Football Locker Room at the one and only, University of Miami! THE U. At Miami, I had the privilege of playing with some of the greatest players to ever play the game. Hall of Famers. And more importantly, WE had the honor of creating a brotherhood that was forged in our daily discipline - to outwork our competition and ALWAYS be the hardest workers in the room. Lifers. This gift is my way of showing love and gratitude to a football program that helped shape and define who I am today as a man. Ups and downs and everything in between. Best of luck this season to my brother & Head Coach Mario Cristobal & his coaching staff. And to our program's anchor - our players, No team in the country will outwork you. It's our obsession and our appetite for disruption. See you at the top."
Looking forward to this one! Tune in this morning at 10:15am EST for our Teremana milestone in the spirits business and more! Join us LIVE on [platform/channel].
Watch full interview here  Meant a lot to me to just sit and chop up life with my guys of @thepivot Hope y’all enjoy
Here's my truth - my dream was never what I am today. I'm so grateful to be where I'm at, however, my driving ambition was this: 'I cannot be f*cking broke.' That's the truth, and that's the chip that remains on my shoulder. So today, I scratch, claw, kick, claw, bite, and fight to never have just $7 bucks again. That feeling never goes away. I love and appreciate every moment I was able to spend and chop up with my guys on The Pivot.
This one's been over a year in the making. Finally, I sit with my boys to chop it all up. A big BIG Pivot @Realrclark25 @FredTaylorMade @OfficialCrowder. Subscribe now and enjoy the ride.
